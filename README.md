# WLAN Pi

The goal of the WLAN Pi is provide wireless LAN professionals with a ready-to-use device capable of providing throughput measurements for assessing network performance. 

The WLAN Pi can be used to test Wired-to-Wired, Wired-to-Wireless, and even Wireless-to-Wireless. These tests can be used to assist in establishing baselines, help with troubleshooting, testing consistency, as well as measuring end-to-end network throughput.
